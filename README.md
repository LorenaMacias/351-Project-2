# 351-Project-2
Lorena Macias (lorenamacias@csu.fullerton.edu),
Kenneth Aguilar (calstateken@csu.fullerton.edu),
Brandon Nguyen (brandon0180@csu.fullerton.edu),
Kemafor Azodoh (kema@csu.fullerton.edu)

The programming language we used is C.
To execute the program: gcc -o main main.c and then 
                        ./main
Lorena, Kema, and Kenneth worked on the header files (memory, process, prototypes, queue). Brandon primarily worked on the main.c file with some assistance from Lorena and Kenneth to unserstand how to use header files.
